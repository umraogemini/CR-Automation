how to create Automation on CR Minon Creation Pipeline using jenkins,github,servicenow and jira
ChatGPT said:
To automate the CR Minion Creation Pipeline using Jenkins, GitHub, ServiceNow, and Jira, follow these steps:

Step 1: Define the Workflow
Goal: Automate CR creation, approval, and tracking in Jira/ServiceNow using Jenkins.
ðŸ“Œ Workflow Steps:

Developer commits code to GitHub (Trigger)

Jenkins pipeline runs and:

Creates a CR in Jira

Syncs the CR with ServiceNow (if required)

CR Auto-Approval if criteria match (e.g., Low Risk)

Deploy changes if CR is approved

Update Jira and ServiceNow with status

Send notifications to Slack/Symphony

Step 2: Set Up Jira and ServiceNow API Integration
Before creating automation, ensure you have: âœ… Jira API access for creating and tracking CRs
âœ… ServiceNow API access for syncing CRs
âœ… Webhook integration between Jenkins & Jira

Jira API - Create a CR
Example Jira API request to create a Change Request:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST "https://your-jira-instance/rest/api/2/issue" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JIRA_TOKEN" \
     -d '{
           "fields": {
               "project": { "key": "CR_PROJECT" },
               "summary": "Automated CR for Deployment",
               "description": "Change Request generated by Jenkins",
               "issuetype": { "name": "Change Request" }
           }
        }'
ServiceNow API - Sync the CR
Once a CR is created in Jira, sync it to ServiceNow:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -X POST "https://your-instance.service-now.com/api/now/table/change_request" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SERVICENOW_TOKEN" \
     -d '{
           "short_description": "CR Created from Jira",
           "category": "Software Deployment",
           "risk": "Low",
           "state": "New"
        }'
Step 3: Create a Jenkins Pipeline for CR Automation
In Jenkins, create a Pipeline Job to handle CR creation and approval.

Jenkins Pipeline Script (Declarative)
groovy
Copy
Edit
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    environment {
        JIRA_API = "https://your-jira-instance/rest/api/2/issue"
        SERVICENOW_API = "https://your-instance.service-now.com/api/now/table/change_request"
        JIRA_TOKEN = credentials('jira-token')   // Store in Jenkins Credentials
        SERVICENOW_TOKEN = credentials('servicenow-token')
    }

    stages {
        stage('Clone Repository') {
            steps {
                git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/your-repo.git'
            }
        }

        stage('Create CR in Jira') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def jiraResponse = sh(script: """
                        curl -X POST "$JIRA_API" \
                        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                        -H "Authorization: Bearer $JIRA_TOKEN" \
                        -d '{
                            "fields": {
                                "project": { "key": "CR_PROJECT" },
                                "summary": "Automated CR for Deployment",
                                "description": "Change Request triggered by Jenkins",
                                "issuetype": { "name": "Change Request" }
                            }
                        }'
                    """, returnStdout: true).trim()

                    echo "Jira CR Created: ${jiraResponse}"
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Sync CR to ServiceNow') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def servicenowResponse = sh(script: """
                        curl -X POST "$SERVICENOW_API" \
                        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                        -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVICENOW_TOKEN" \
                        -d '{
                            "short_description": "CR Created from Jira",
                            "category": "Software Deployment",
                            "risk": "Low",
                            "state": "New"
                        }'
                    """, returnStdout: true).trim()

                    echo "ServiceNow CR Created: ${servicenowResponse}"
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Auto-Approve CR') {
            steps {
                script {
                    def autoApprovalCriteriaMet = true  // Add logic to evaluate criteria

                    if (autoApprovalCriteriaMet) {
                        sh """
                            curl -X PATCH "$SERVICENOW_API/CR_ID" \
                            -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                            -H "Authorization: Bearer $SERVICENOW_TOKEN" \
                            -d '{ "state": "Approved" }'
                        """
                        echo "CR Approved Automatically"
                    } else {
                        echo "CR Requires Manual Approval"
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy Application') {
            when {
                expression { autoApprovalCriteriaMet }
            }
            steps {
                echo "Deploying application..."
                // Add deployment steps (e.g., Helm, Terraform, etc.)
            }
        }

        stage('Update Jira Status') {
            steps {
                sh """
                    curl -X PUT "$JIRA_API/CR_ID" \
                    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                    -H "Authorization: Bearer $JIRA_TOKEN" \
                    -d '{ "fields": { "status": "Approved" } }'
                """
                echo "Jira CR Status Updated"
            }
        }

        stage('Notify Teams') {
            steps {
                sh """
                    curl -X POST "https://hooks.slack.com/services/your-webhook-url" \
                    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                    -d '{ "text": "CR Approved & Deployment Started :rocket:" }'
                """
            }
        }
    }
}
Step 4: Store CR Approvals in Jira Dashboards
Once a CR is auto-approved:

Update Jira tickets with the CR status

Create a Jira dashboard with filters like:

Approved CRs

Pending CRs

Rejected CRs

ðŸ”¹ JQL Example to track Approved CRs:

ini
Copy
Edit
project = "CR_PROJECT" AND status = "Approved"
Step 5: Send Email Alerts on CR Approval
Use Jenkins Email Plugin or Jira Notifications to alert teams when a CR is approved.

Example Jenkins Email Notification:

groovy
Copy
Edit
post {
    success {
        mail to: 'team@example.com',
             subject: 'CR Approved & Deployment Started',
             body: "The Change Request has been auto-approved and deployment has started."
    }
}
Step 6: Monitor & Optimize
âœ… Check Jenkins logs for API errors
âœ… Adjust auto-approval criteria (if required)
âœ… Track CR lifecycle in Jira & ServiceNow dashboards
âœ… Enable Slack/Symphony notifications

Final Outcome
ðŸš€ Automated CR pipeline in Jenkins
ðŸ“Œ Jira & ServiceNow sync for CR tracking
âœ… Auto-approve CRs based on conditions
ðŸ“Š Track approvals in Jira dashboards
ðŸ“¢ Get real-time Slack/Email alerts
